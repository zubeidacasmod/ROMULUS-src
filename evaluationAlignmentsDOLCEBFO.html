<h4> Philosophical Notions behind DOLCE and BFO</h4>
<p><b>DOLCE: </b>It is descriptive in nature meaning that  ontological categories underlying natural language as
well as common sense are captured. DOLCE is an ontology of particulars. Particulars are entities that cannot be instantiated. </p>

<p><b>BFO: </b>It is a realist in a sense as it aims to captures the world exactly as is. As such, abstract entities are not included. BFO is an ontology of universals. Universals are entities that can be instantiated. </p>

<th>Annotation and example of concept</th>
<td>The main characteristic of endurants is that all of them are independent essential wholes. Endurants can 'genuinely' change in time,  in the sense that the very same endurant as a whole can have incompatible properties at different times. To see this, suppose that an endurant - say 'this paper' - has a  property at a time t 'it's white', and a different, incompatible property at time t'  'it's yellow': in both cases we refer to the whole object, without picking up any  particular part of it. </td>
<td>A continuant is an entity [bfo:Entity] that exists in full at any time in which it exists at all, persists through time while maintaining its identity and has no temporal parts. An independant continuant is a continuant [snap:Continuant] that is a bearer of quality [snap:Quality] and realizable entity [snap:RealizableEntity] entities, in which other entities inhere and which itself cannot inhere in anything. Examples: an organism, a heart, a leg, a person, a symphony orchestra, a chair, the bottom right portion of a human torso, the lawn and atmosphere in front of our building.</td>

<tr>
<th>Annotation and example of concept</th>
<td>The main characteristic of physical objects is that  they are endurants with unity. However, they have no common unity criterion, since  different subtypes of objects may  have different unity criteria. Differently from  aggregates, (most) physical objects change some of their parts while keeping their  identity, they can have therefore temporary parts. Often physical objects (indeed,  all endurants) are ontologically independent from occurrences (discussed below).  However, if we admit that every object has a life, it is hard to exclude a mutual  specific constant dependence between the two. Nevertheless, we may still use the  notion of dependence to (weakly) characterize objects as being not specifically  constantly dependent on other objects.</td>
<td>Definition: A material entity [snap:MaterialEntity] that is a mereological sum of separate object [snap:Object] entities and possesses non-connected boundaries.</td>

<td>Definition: A realizable entity [snap:RealizableEntity] the manifestation of which brings about some result or end that is not essential to a continuant [snap:Continuant] in virtue of the kind of thing that it is but that can be served or participated in by that kind of continuant [snap:Continuant] in some kinds of natural, social or institutional contexts. Examples: the role of a person as a surgeon, the role of a chemical compound in an experiment, the role of a patient relative as defined by a hospital administrative form, the role of a woman as a legal mother in the context of system of laws, the role of a biological grandfather as legal guardian in the context of a system of laws, the role of ingested matter in digestion, the role of a student in a university</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<th>Annotation and example of concept</th>
<td>Perdurants (AKA occurrences) comprise what are variously called events, processes, phenomena, activities and states. They can have temporal parts or spatial parts. For instance, the first movement of (an execution of) a symphony is a temporal part of the symphony. On the other hand, the play performed by the left side of the orchestra is a spatial part. In both cases, these parts are occurrences themselves. We assume that objects cannot be parts of occurrences, but rather they participate in them. Perdurants extend in time by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present, they are only partially present, in  the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be not present. E.g., the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present, while some temporal parts of your reading are not present yet, or any more. Philosophers say that endurants are entities that are in time, while lacking temporal parts (so to speak, all their parts flow with them in time). Perdurants, on the contrary, are entities that happen in time, and can have temporal parts (all their parts are fixed in time).</td>
<td>Definition: An entity [bfo:Entity] that has temporal parts and that happens, unfolds or develops through time. Sometimes also called perdurants. Examples: the life of an organism, a surgical operation as processual context for a nosocomical infection, the spatiotemporal context occupied by a process of cellular meiosis, the most interesting part of Van Gogh's life, the spatiotemporal region occupied by the development of a cancer tumor.</td>

<td>Qualities can be seen as the basic entities we can  perceive or measure: shapes, colors, sizes, sounds, smells, as well as weights, lengths,  electrical charges... 'Quality' is often used as a synonymous of 'property', but this is  not the case in this upper ontology: qualities are particulars, properties are universals.  Qualities inhere to entities: every entity (including qualities themselves) comes with  certain qualities, which exist as long as the entity exists.</td>
<td>Definition: A specifically dependent continuant [snap:SpecificallyDependentContinuant] that is exhibited if it inheres in an entity or entities at all (a categorical property).
