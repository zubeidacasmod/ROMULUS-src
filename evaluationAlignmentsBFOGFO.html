        <h4> Philosophical Notions behind BFO and GFO</h4>
<p><b>BFO: </b>It is a realist in a sense as it aims to captures the world exactly as is. As such, abstract entities are not included. BFO is an ontology of universals. Universals are entities that can be instantiated. </p>
<p><b>GFO: </b>It is descriptive in nature meaning that  ontological categories underlying natural language as
well as common sense are captured. GFO is an ontology of individuals. Individuals are entities that cannot be instantiated.  </p>

<td>Persistants are GFO's way to capture identity over time. GFO pursues an approach which accounts for persistence by means of a suitable universal whose instances are presentials. Such universals are called persistants. These do not change and they can be used to explain how presentials which have different properties at different times can nevertheless be the same.</td>

For every material persistant P there exists a process P such that the set of instances of P coincides with the set of process-boundaries of P. This implies the existence of a chronoid c such that for every time-point t of c there exists exactly one instance of P at time point t.</td>
