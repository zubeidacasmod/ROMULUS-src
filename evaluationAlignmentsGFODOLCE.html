For every material persistant P there exists a P such that the set of instances of P coincides with the set of process-boundaries of P.

<td>The main characteristic of physical objects is that  they are endurants with unity. However, they have no common unity criterion, since  different subtypes of objects may  have different unity criteria. Differently from  aggregates, (most) physical objects change some of their parts while keeping their  identity, they can have therefore temporary parts. Often physical objects (indeed,  all endurants) are ontologically independent from occurrences (discussed below).  However, if we admit that every object has a life, it is hard to exclude a mutual  specific constant dependence between the two. Nevertheless, we may still use the  notion of dependence to (weakly) characterize objects as being not specifically  constantly dependent on other objects.</td>

The time and space (and possibly other qualities) of a situation are the time and space of the perdurants in the setting.</td>

<td>Occurrents have temporal parts and thus cannot be present at a time-boundary. Time belongs to them, because they happen in time and the time of the occurrent is built into it. The relation between an occurrent and a chronoid is determined by the projection relation. Occurrents are also called generalized processes in the GFO.</td>
<td>Perdurants (AKA occurrences) comprise what are variously called events, processes, phenomena, activities and states. They can have temporal parts or spatial parts. For instance, the first movement of (an execution of) a symphony is a temporal part of the symphony. On the other hand, the play performed by the left side of the orchestra is a spatial part. In both cases, these parts are occurrences themselves. We assume that objects cannot be parts of occurrences, but rather they participate in them. Perdurants extend in time by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present, they are only partially present, in  the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be not present. E.g., the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present, while some temporal parts of your reading are not present yet, or any more. Philosophers say that endurants are entities that are in time, while lacking temporal parts (so to speak, all their parts flow with them in time). Perdurants, on the contrary, are entities that happen in time, and can have temporal parts (all their parts are fixed in time).</td>

<td>Property values usually appear in groups which are called value structures, value spaces or measurement systems.
Each of these structures corresponds to some property. More intuitively, one could say that the property may be measured with respect to some measurement system.
For instance, sizes may be measured with the values ``small'' ``big'' or ``very big'', which are the elements of one value structure. The notion of a value structure of a property is similar to a quality dimension in (Gardenfors, 2000). Further, value structures are related to quality spaces in DOLCE (Masolo, 2003}. A quality space consists of all ``quales'' (our property values) of some ``quality'' (our property). Often it seems to be the case that a notion of distance can be defined, and that certain layers of value structures are isomorphic to some subset of real numbers, which allows for a mapping of values to pairs of a real number and a unit, as in the case of ``10 kg''.</td>
<td>A quality space is a topologically maximal region. The constraint of maximality cannot be given completely in OWL, but a constraint is given that creates a partition out of all quality spaces (e.g. no two quality spaces can overlap mereologically).</td>
